At the moment, Forge has a workflow with two Github Actions:

(1) continuous integration
(2) semantic version renaming. 

The semantic version renaming action will look for the following tags, which correspond to increments of different tiers of version number:
[major] (+.x.x)
[minor] (x.+.x)
[patch] (x.x.+)

Placing the correct tag in a commit message, pushing to a branch, making a pull request into master, and approving the request will run the action and increment the version number kept in info.rkt.
